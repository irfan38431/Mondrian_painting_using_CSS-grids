# Mondrian Painting Project

This project is an HTML and CSS-based recreation of Piet Mondrian's iconic style of abstract geometric art. Using CSS Grid, the layout mimics the balance of color, form, and simplicity seen in Mondrian's paintings.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of CSS Grid to build a Mondrian-style painting with a flexible and structured layout. The painting is composed of primary colors (red, blue, yellow), white spaces, and black gridlines that separate the elements.

### Colors Used:
- **Gap (Black):** #000
- **White:** #F0F1EC
- **Red:** #E72F24
- **Blue:** #004592
- **Yellow:** #F9D01E

### Grid Layout:
The project uses a 4x4 grid system with varying column and row sizes, spanning some grid items to create irregularly shaped blocks to match Mondrianâ€™s design aesthetic.
